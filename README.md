# About the Application
I have used tkinter in order to make the GUI interface of the application which will help the user to navigate between the functions of the applications. I have also used pillow module to implement images in the GUI. The main database which is used to store details of spending is used by the sqlite3 which is very good for beginners to use the database who do not have any idea about the Oracle or any other database which uses sql. As soon as the application is launched the user will we able to see the five-options named (Employee, Supplier, Category, Product and Sales).
